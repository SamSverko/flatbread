## Ingredients

-   ⅓ cup chicken broth
-   1 tbsp oyster sauce
-   1 tbsp soy sauce, or as needed
-   2 tsp fish sauce
-   1 tsp white sugar
-   1 tsp brown sugar
-   2 tbsp vegetable oil
-   1 lb skinless, boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped
-   ¼ cup sliced shallots
-   4 cloves garlic, minced
-   2 tbsp minced Thai chilis, Serrano, or other hot pepper
-   1 cup fresh basil, very thinly sliced
-   1 cups hot cooked rice

## Directions

1. Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white and brown sugar together in a bowl until well blended.
1. Heat large skilled over high heat. Drizzle in oil. Add chicken and stir fry until it loses its raw color, 2-3 minutes. Stir in shallots, garlic, and sliced chilis.
1. Continue cooking on high heat until some of the juices start to caramelize in the bottom of the pan, about 2-3 more minutes.
1. Add about a tbsp of the sauce mixture to the skillet; cook and stir until sauce begins to caramelize, about 1 minute.
1. Pour in the rest of the sauce. Cook and stir until sauce has deglazed the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook until sauce glazes onto the meat, 1-2 more minutes. Remove from heat.
1. Stir in basil. Cook and stir until basil has wilted, about 20 seconds. Serve with rice.

## Notes

-   To slice basil leaves, stack about 5 of them and roll tightly like a cigar. Then slice into thin ribbons. Make a couple of cuts in the opposite direction for smaller pieces that cook faster.

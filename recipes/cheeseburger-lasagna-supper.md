## Ingredients

-   1 tbsp canola oil
-   450 g lean ground pork
-   1 onion, chopped
-   1 sweet yellow pepper, chopped
-   2 cloves garlic, minced
-   1 ½ tsp paprika
-   ½ tsp pepper
-   Pinch salt
-   2 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth
-   3 cups short Mafalda pasta
-   2 cups jarred marinara sauce
-   1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese
-   ¼ chopped parsley

## Directions

1. In a large pot, heat oil over medium-high heat. Cook pork, stirring, until browned, about 4 minutes.
1. Stir in onion, yellow pepper, garlic, paprika, pepper and salt; cook until starting to soften, about 4 minutes.
1. Stir in broth, scraping up browned bits. Add pasta, marinara sauce and ¼ cup water; bring to boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook, stirring halfway through, until pasta is al dente, about 10 minutes.
1. Remove from heat. Stir in mozzarella; sprinkle with parsley. Sprinkle with additional mozzarella, if desired.

## Notes

-   Short Mafalda pasta looks like mini lasagna noodles with crinkly edges. If you can’t find it, substitute any short pasta, like rotini.

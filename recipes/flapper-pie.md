## Ingredients

### Crust

-   1 ¼ cups graham cracker crumbs
-   ¼ cup melted butter
-   ½ cup sugar
-   1 dash cinnamon

### Meringue

-   3 egg whites
-   ¼ cup sugar
-   ¼ tsp cream of tartar (optional)

### Filling

-   2 ½ cups homogenized milk
-   ½ cup white sugar
-   ¼ cup cornstarch
-   3 egg yolks
-   1 tsp vanilla
-   Pinch of salt

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
1. **Crust:** Mix all the crust ingredients together, save about 2 tbsp to the side and press the rest into a 10-inch pie plate, in the bottom and up the sides. Refrigerate.
1. **Filling:** Combine the filling ingredients together and cook on a medium heat until it boils and thickens, making sure to stir constantly! Set aside to cool while you make the meringue.
1. **Meringue:** Beat the meringue ingredients together until they form stiff peaks.
1. Pour the filling into the crust and top with the meringue, making beautiful little spikes that will brown up on top. Sprinkle the rest of the crust crumbs on the top and bake in oven until the meringue browns, around 10 minutes.

## Notes

-   Cool in the fridge. Enjoy sooner rather than later.

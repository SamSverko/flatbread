## Ingredients

-   2 tbsp olive oil
-   1 small onion, chopped
-   2-3 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
-   1 (473 ml) jar roasted red peppers, drained and chopped
-   ½ cup low-sodium chicken stock or vegetable stock
-   1 cup crumbled feta cheese, or a 170 g block
-   1 lb whole-wheat fettuccine
-   Salt
-   Freshly ground black pepper
-   2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley leaves

## Directions

1. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté onion and garlic until soft, about 10 minutes.
1. Add roasted peppers and sauté until heated through. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
1. Place mixture in the bowl of a food processor with stock and all but 2 tbsp of the feta. Process until combined and smooth, about 30 seconds.
1. Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain, reserving ½ cup pasta water. Toss pasta with sauce, adding pasta water by the tbsp, if needed. Sauce should cling nicely to pasta.
1. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Divide among pasta bowls. Sprinkle with parsley and remaining feta cheese.

## Ingredients

### For the chicken tikka

- boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts 675g, cut into 2½cm chunks
- salt 1¼ tsp
- lemon juice 3 tbsp
- root ginger 1 tbsp, peeled, finely grated
- garlic 2 cloves, finely grated or crushed
- ground cumin 1 tsp
- paprika 1 tsp
- chilli powder ½–¾ tsp
- whipping cream 6 tbsp
- garam masala ½ tsp
- olive or sunflower oil 3 tbsp

### For the masala

- olive or sunflower oil 4 tbsp
- onions 140g, halved and finely sliced
- root ginger 1 tbsp, peeled, finely grated
- garlic 5–6 cloves, crushed
- ground coriander 1 tbsp
- turmeric ½ tsp
- chilli powder ¾ tsp
- paprika 2 tsp
- yogurt 4 tbsp
- tomatoes 2 medium, peeled and very finely chopped
- chicken stock 350ml
- salt ¼ tsp, or to taste
- garam masala ¼ ts
- coriander leaves 4 tbsp, chopped

## Directions

1. Start by marinating the chicken tikka. Put the chicken in a non-reactive bowl and rub in the salt and lemon juice. Prod the chicken pieces lightly with the tip of a knife and rub the seasonings in again, then set aside for 20 minutes. Add the ginger, garlic, cumin, paprika, chilli powder, cream and garam masala. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours (longer will not hurt).
1. When you’re ready to cook, make the masala: pour the 4 tablespoons of oil into a large, preferably non-stick, lidded pan and set it over a medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, put in the onions. Stir and fry until they brown, 6 or 7 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and continue to fry, stirring, for a minute. Add the ground coriander, turmeric, chilli powder and paprika. Stir for 10 seconds, then add a tablespoon of the yogurt. Stir and fry until it is absorbed. Add the remaining yogurt in this way, a tablespoon at a time.
1. Now put in the tomatoes. Fry them for 3 or 4 minutes, or until they turn pulpy. Add the stock and salt, and bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer gently for 15–20 minutes. The sauce should turn thick. Stir in the garam masala and coriander leaves, taste for seasoning and add more salt if you need it.
1. Shortly before you eat, preheat the grill to its highest setting. Thread the chicken on to 2 to 4 skewers (the flat, sword-like ones are best). Brush with the 3 tablespoons of oil and balance the skewers on the rim of a shallow baking tray, so that the meat is suspended and does not touch the tray. Place about 13 centimetres (5 inches) from the source of heat and grill for 6 minutes on each side, or until lightly browned, cooked through and charred in places. (Cut a large piece of chicken to the centre to check there is no trace of pink.)
1. When the tikkas are cooked, reheat the sauce and fold in the chicken. Serve immediately.

- 1/2 tsp salt 3g
- 1/4 tsp sesame oil 3g
- 1/8 tsp white pepper 1g

### Aromatics

- 3 to 4 pieces dried tangerine or mandarin orange peel
- 6 dried red chili peppers (Or 1 tsp red pepper flakes)
- 3 star anise
- 1 clove garlic minced 5g
- 1 knob ginger minced 5g

### Chicken Coating

- 1 cup cornstarch 160g
- 1 Egg
- ½ c Flour 60g

### Sauce

- 1 cup Orange Juice 240g
- 1/4 cup Sugar 50g
- 2 Tbsp Rice Vinegar or White Vinegar 30g
- 1 Tbsp Soy Sauce 15g

### Garnish

- Toasted Sesame Seeds (Garnish)
- Sliced scallions (Garnish)

## Directions

1. Cut the chicken thighs into grape-sized bits… some larger, some smaller. Size differences work well for this recipe in my opinion.
1. Marinate the chicken for 20-30 minutes while you hydrate the mandarin peels, chilis, and star anise.
1. When the chicken is ready, rub on 1 Tbsp cornstarch 10g.
1. Then coat with a thick batter made from 1 Egg and ¼ cup Cornstarch 40g.
1. Fully coat the battered chicken in a 1:1 mix of flour and cornstarch.
1. Shallow fry in about ½ inch or 1 cm or oil till golden brown 4-5 minutes.
1. **Note:** For EXTRA crispy chicken, pull the chicken out when it is light brown, replace the oil and then fry again at 400F/200C till golden brown.
1. Lightly toast the hydrated aromatics for a few minutes, saving the hydrating liquid to make a cornstarch slurry with 1 Tbsp cornstarch 10g for 2Tbsp liquid 30g.
1. Once toasted, add minced garlic and ginger for 20-30 seconds before pouring in the sauce.
1. Once the sauce simmers, add the slurry slowly until the sauce reaches its desired consistency. (You may not need it all).
1. Toss your chicken in the sauce to coat and then garnish.

## Ingredients

-   8 bone-in-skin-on chicken thighs (about 1.1 kg)
-   4 yellow-fleshed potatoes, scrubbed and cut in 1-inch thick rounds
-   3 cloves garlic, smashed
-   3 tbsp olive oil
-   ¼ cup Greek seasoning
-   ½ tsp each salt and pepper
-   1 lemon, halved
-   4 cups watercress or arugula

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450°F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. On pan, toss together chicken, potatoes, garlic and oil to coat; sprinkle with Greek seasoning, salt and pepper.
1. Arrange in single layer with chicken skin side up. Add lemon, cut side up. Roast, rotating pan halfway through, until juices run clear when chicken is pierced and potatoes are tender, 35-40 minutes.
1. Add watercress; toss to combine. Return to oven; roast just until watercress is wilted, 1-2 minutes. Squeeze lemon over top; discard lemon halves. Divide chicken, potatoes and watercress among plates.

## Notes

-   If substituting arugula for the watercress, there’s no need to return the pan to the oven. Just toss and serve!

## Ingredients

-   1 tablespoon olive oil
-   1 onion chopped
-   3 large cloves garlic minced
-   1 jalapeño diced and seeded
-   3 cups chicken broth
-   14 ½ ounces crushed tomatoes
-   14 ½ ounces can black beans rinsed & drained
-   10 ounces canned diced tomatoes with chiles such as Rotel
-   2 chicken breasts boneless, skinless
-   1 cup corn drained if canned
-   ¼ cup cilantro chopped
-   1 teaspoon chili powder
-   1 teaspoon ground cumin
-   1 lime juiced
-   1 avocado sliced, for garnish

### For the Tortilla Strips

-   6 6" corn tortillas cut into ¼" strips
-   ¼ cup vegetable oil
-   salt

## Directions

1. For the tortilla strips, cut the tortillas into ¼-inch strips. In a small pan, heat ¼ cup of vegetable oil over medium-high heat.
1. Add the tortillas, in small batches to the oil and fry them until they are crisp, about 1 minute per side. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towel. While warm, sprinkle with salt to taste.
1. In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and jalapeño to the pot, and cook until the onion is softened, about 3 to 4 minutes.
1. Add in the chicken broth, black beans, crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes with juices, corn, lime juice, cilantro, ground cumin, and chili powder. Stir to combine.
1. Add the chicken breasts and bring the soup to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook uncovered for 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
1. Remove the chicken from the pot and shred it with two forks. Add the shredded chicken back to the pot and simmer for an additional 3 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
1. Spoon soup into bowls and top with tortilla strips, lime wedges, and sliced avocado.

## Ingredients

-   680 g turkey breast
-   340 g green beans, trimmed
-   680 g red potatoes
-   2 tbsp Cajun seasoning
-   2 ½ tsp Dijon mustard
-   25 g shallots
-   227 g cherry tomatoes
-   6 tbsp sour cream
-   2 tbsp white wine vinegar
-   113 g spring salad mix
-   1 tsp sugar
-   Pinch of salt
-   1 tbsp oil

## Directions

1. Adding finely chopped raw shallots to the dressing will add some spicy heat. If you want to tone down the spiciness a notch, simply add a little less than what we call for.
1. Wash and dry all produce. Peel and finely chop 1 tbsp shallot (double for 4 ppl). Halve the tomatoes. Cut the green beans into 1-inch pieces. Cut the potatoes in half or in quarters if they are larger.
1. In a medium pot, combine the potatoes with enough salted water to cover (approximately 1-2 inches). Bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until the potatoes are fork-tender, 10-12 min.
1. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the sour cream, mustard, 1 tbsp vinegar (double for 4 ppl) and 1/2 tsp sugar (double for 4 ppl). Stir in the shallot. Season with salt and pepper. Reserve half the dressing into a small bowl and set both aside.
1. Pat the turkey dry with paper towels, then sprinkle both sides with the Cajun seasoning. Season with salt and pepper. Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. Add a drizzle of oil, then the turkey.
1. Cook until golden-brown and cooked through, 3-5 min per side. (TIP: Cook to a minimum internal temp. of 74°C/165°F, as size may vary.)
1. When the potatoes are fork-tender, add the green beans to the pot. Boil until the beans are tender-crisp, 1-2 min. Drain and add the potatoes and green beans to the medium bowl with the dressing.
1. Stir to coat veggies in the dressing. Season with salt and pepper.
1. Thinly slice the turkey. Divide the spring mix between plates. In single rows, top with the potato mixture, turkey and tomatoes. Drizzle over as much of the reserved dressing as you like.

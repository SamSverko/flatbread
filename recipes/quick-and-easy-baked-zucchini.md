## Ingredients

- 600g / 1.2lb zucchinis (4 large, 5 medium)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 tsp each salt and pepper
- 2 tbsp breadcrumbs
- 2 tbsp parmesan, grated (store bought sandy type is best)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 240°C / 450°F (220°C fan) with the oven shelf set high in the oven.
1. Trim the ends off the zucchini. Cut medium zucchinis in quarters lengthwise, and large ones into sixths (halve then cut each half into 3 lengthwise to make 6 long "wedges").
1. Pile zucchini on a tray. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil, salt and pepper. Toss.
1. Line up in two rows so they're touching each other, with the skin side down.
1. Sprinkle evenly with breadcrumbs, then parmesan, drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil.
1. Bake 12 minutes until the parmesan is golden and zucchini is soft but not soggy.
1. Serve immediately!

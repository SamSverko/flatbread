## Directions

### Salisbury Steak

1. In a large mixing bowl add egg, onion, garlic, breadcrumbs, ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire and bouillon cube.
1. Using a fork, whisk together the ingredients until fully combined and leave for 10 minutes and allow the breadcrumbs to soften.
1. Add ground beef, salt and pepper and gently mix to fully combine. Form the beef mixture into 4-6 oval patties and set aside.
1. In a large skillet over medium high heat, add oil. Once shimmering, add beef patties and cook until deeply golden brown. Flip and repeat on the other side. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
1. Add to oven and cook for 20 min

### Sarsaparilla Gravy

1. Using the same skillet, reduce the heat to medium low and add butter, onions, garlic and a pinch of salt. Stir to combine and cook until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.
1. Sprinkle flour over the vegetables and stir to combine. Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the flour smells nutty and turns blonde.
1. Add yellow mustard, Worcestershire, soy sauce, root beer and beef stock. Whisk to break up any lumps and bring to a simmer.
1. Simmer until the sauce is thickened and reduced to desired consistency. Add salt and pepper to taste, stir, then remove from the heat. Cover with a lid and set aside.

### Mashed Potatoes

1. In a medium sauce pot, add potatoes and enough cold water to cover them by 1 inch.
1. Season with salt, and bring to a boil over medium high heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork tender.
1. Drain the potatoes and add back to the pot over low heat. Cook until the potatoes are chalky and any excess water has been cooked off. Add cream, butter, salt and pepper and gently stir to combine and break down the potatoes.

### Broccoli

1. In a medium sautoir over medium heat, add ½ inch of water, salt and broccoli. Cover with a lid and bring it to a boil. Cook until the broccoli is bright green and tender crisp, about 5 minutes.
1. Drain the broccoli and transfer to a plate. Grate cheddar cheese over top.

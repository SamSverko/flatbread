## Ingredients

- Flour 950g / 33.5oz, use baker's flour or bread flour as called in the US (higher protein content, the one I use has 11.5g of protein per 100g)
- Salt 2x good tsp, approx 16g / 0.56oz
- Dry Yeast 3/4 tsp, approx 2g / 0.07oz
- Water 730ml / 25.7oz, I use filtered water at room temperature

## Directions

### Part 1

1. Mix all the ingredients together until combined, you will see the dough will amalgamate into a ball, this should not take more than 2mn.
1. Cover and let it rise for 8 to 10 hours, I leave the dough in the cold oven.

### Part 2

1. Sprinkle some flour on the bench or a pizza dish/plate, scrape the dough on the dish and sprinkle again some more flour on top to avoid sticking. You will need a plastic dough scraper and make sure you're not pressing the dough to keep the air inside.
1. Cut the dough in 4 (if you want 4 baguettes, but you can make 2/3/5).
1. Take each piece and stretch it gently into a baguette shape and put it on a baking tray or plate with baking paper. This should not take more than 3 mn and if you're well organised cleaning included.
1. Bake at 250 degC (480 degF) for approx 25 mn in a pre heated oven depending how golden you want them.
1. Et voila.

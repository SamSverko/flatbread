## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups plus 1 tablespoon (368 grams) lukewarm water
- 1 heaping teaspoon (3 ½ grams) active dry yeast, or 1 teaspoon (2.7 grams) instant dried yeast, or 1 tablespoon (8 ½ grams) fresh yeast
- 5 ¼ cups (613 grams) “00” flour, plus extra for dusting
- 3 teaspoons (18 grams) sea salt 

## Directions

1. Add the water and yeast to a large bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer) and whisk until thoroughly blended. Combine the flour and salt in a medium bowl, then add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients.
1. **If using a mixer:** Fit the mixer with the dough hook and pour the flour and yeast mixture into the mixer bowl. Turn the machine on at a low speed for 5 to 10 minutes, or until it’s firm and stretchy. Cover the dough with a dish towel and leave to rise in a warm place for about 2 hours, or until doubled in size.
1. **If mixing by hand:** Stir with a wooden spoon until a dough starts to form. Continue mixing by hand until the pizza dough comes together in a ball. Place the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead with both hands for about 10 minutes, until it’s firm and stretchy. Return the dough to the bowl. Cover with a dish towel and leave to rise in a warm place for about 2 hours, or until doubled in size.
1. **Tip:** Make more dough than you need, or just want to have some on hand in a pinch? No problem. The best time to freeze your homemade pizza dough is after the first rise (after it's doubled in size). Once your dough has doubled in size, divide it into equal dough balls. Make sure you've put a light layer of olive oil into your containers to prevent the dough from sticking. Place the dough balls into separate containers with lids, and place in the freezer. You can freeze your dough balls for up to 3 months.
1. When the dough is ready, divide it into 3 or 4 equal pieces, depending on the size of pizza you’re making – either 12 inches (30 centimeters) or 16 inches (40 centimeters) wide. Place each piece of dough in a separate bowl or tray, cover with a dish towel and leave to rise in a warm place for another 30 to 60 minutes, or until doubled in size.
1. **Tip:** Always start with a perfectly rounded ball of dough. This helps to keep the shape of the base circular during the stretching process.
1. Before stretching and topping your dough, fire up your oven and allow it to preheat for 15 to 20 minutes. Aim for 850 °F and 950 °F (450 °C and 500 °C) on your baking stone. You can check this quickly, accurately and from a safe distance with an infrared thermometer.
1. When the dough is ready, place the ball on a lightly floured surface, flour your hands and use your fingertips to press the dough into a small, flat disc. Working from the center, push the dough outwards while spreading your fingers, making the disc slightly bigger. Pick up the dough and gently pinch it all around the edge, allowing gravity to pull it downwards into a circle. Neapolitan-style pizza bases are very thin, so you should be able to see through the base when you hold it up to the light. Take care when doing this, as you don’t want it to tear.
1. Once the dough is fully stretched, lightly flour your pizza peel and lay the base on it. If at this point you see any small holes in the dough, gently pinch them back together. Once you’re happy with the base, add your toppings.
1. When your oven is hot enough, launch your pizza and cook it for 1 to 2 minutes, turning every 20 seconds to ensure an even bake.
1. Remove from the oven, slice, serve and enjoy that pizza greatness!

## Ingredients

-   2 cups tomatoes, in addition to their juices (for example, an 828 ml can of San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes)
-   5 tbsp butter
-   1 onion, peeled and cut in half
-   Salt

## Directions

1. Combine the tomatoes, their juices, the butter and the onion halves in a saucepan. Add a pinch or two of salt.
1. Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, for about 45 minutes. Stir occasionally, mashing any large pieces of tomato with a spoon. Add salt as needed.
1. Discard the onion before tossing the sauce with pasta. This recipe makes enough sauce for a pound of pasta.

## Ingredients

-   2 zucchini
-   227 g heirloom grape tomatoes
-   ¼ g fresh thyme
-   4 scallions
-   1 ½ cup Israeli couscous
-   2 tsp smoked paprika
-   1 (454 g) box chickpeas
-   1 cup feta cheese
-   2 tbsp vegetable stock concentrate
-   1 lemon
-   4 garlic cloves

## Directions

1. Wash and dry all produce. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Trim zucchini, then cut into ½-inch cubes. Halve tomatoes lengthwise.
1. Strip thyme leaves from stems. Discard stems. Trim, then thinly slice scallions, keeping greens and whites separate. Mince or grate garlic. Halve lemon.
1. Toss zucchini, tomatoes, and half the thyme on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Roast in oven until tender, about 20 minutes, tossing halfway through.
1. Meanwhile, drain and rinse half the chickpeas from the box (use the rest as you like).
1. On another baking sheet, toss chickpeas, smoked paprika, a drizzle of olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Roast in oven until crisp, about 20 minutes, tossing halfway through. TIP: Chickpeas may pop in oven—it’s natural.
1. Heat 1 TBSP butter, garlic, and scallion whites in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Once butter is melted and garlic is fragrant, add couscous and remaining thyme. Stir to coat.
1. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, tossing, until couscous is lightly toasted, 2-3 minutes.
1. Stir stock concentrate and 1½ cups water into pot. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and reduce to a simmer. Cook until couscous is al dente, 10-12 minutes.
1. Add half the veggies, half the feta, and a squeeze of lemon to pot with couscous and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper.
1. Divide couscous mixture between plates, then top with remaining veggies and chickpeas. Sprinkle with scallion greens and remaining feta.

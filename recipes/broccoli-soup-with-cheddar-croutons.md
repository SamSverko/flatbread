## Ingredients

### Broccoli Soup

-   1 broccoli
-   1 tablespoon butter
-   3 leeks (white and light green parts only) sliced
-   2 yellow-fleshed potatoes (about 450 g total) peeled and (cut in 1/2-inch (1 cm) cubes
-   4 garlic sliced
-   3/4 teaspoons dried savory
-   1 teaspoon dry mustard
-   1 pkg (900 ml) sodium-reduced vegetable broth
-   1 cup shredded extra-old white Cheddar cheese
-   1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
-   1/2 cup sour cream
-   1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper

### Cheddar Croutons

-   3 cups cubed (1/2 inch/1 cm) baguette (about one-third baguette)
-   2 teaspoons olive oil
-   1/2 cup shredded extra-old white Cheddar cheese

## Directions

### Broccoli Soup

1. Cut stem from broccoli head; cut head into florets to yield 5 cups. Trim bottom end from stem; peel outer layer. Slice stem to yield 3/4 cup. Set aside.
1. In Dutch oven or large heavy-bottomed saucepan, melt butter over medium heat; cook leeks, potatoes and broccoli stem, stirring occasionally, until leeks are softened, about 12 minutes. Add garlic, savory and mustard; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
1. Stir in broth and 2 cups water; bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in broccoli florets; simmer until broccoli stems and potatoes are tender, about 8 minutes. Stir in Cheddar until melted; stir in parsley.
1. Working in batches, purée soup in blender until smooth. Pour into clean Dutch oven or large saucepan; heat over medium-low. Whisk in sour cream, salt and pepper; cook until heated through. (Make-ahead: Refrigerate in airtight container for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 2 weeks.)

### Cheddar Croutons

1. While soup is simmering, in bowl, toss baguette with oil to coat. Arrange in single layer on parchment paper–lined baking sheet; sprinkle with Cheddar. Bake in 400°F (200°C) oven, turning once, until baguette is golden and cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. Break apart croutons; serve over soup.

## Notes

-   **Tip from The Test Kitchen:** When blending a hot soup, work in small batches and remove the vent from your blender lid, covering the hole with a folded tea towel to relieve any pressure caused by escaping steam.

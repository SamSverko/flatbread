## Ingredients

-   Coarsely ground beef (see note): 1 lb (400g)
-   Fresh pork pancetta, slices: 6 oz (150g)
-   ½ onion, peeled: about 2 oz (60g)
-   1 medium carrot, peeled: about 2 oz (60g)
-   1 celery stalk, trimmed: about 2 oz (60g)
-   ½ cup (1 glass) of red or white wine
-   Strained tomatoes: 7 oz (200g)
-   Tomato paste (double-concentrated): 1 tbsp
-   ½ cup (1 glass) of whole milk (optional)
-   Light meat or vegetable broth (or stock cubes)
-   Extra virgin olive oil: 3 tbsp
-   Salt and pepper

## Directions

1. In a heavy non-stick 10-inch (24-26cm) casserole (aluminium or enamelled cast-iron (Dutch oven) or terracotta saucepans can be used), melt the ground or chopped pancetta with olive oil.
1. Using a chef’s or chopping knife, finely chop the onion, celery, and carrot (do not use a food processor); add the vegetables to the oil and pancetta and cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until softened but not browned.
1. Raise the heat to medium and add the meat, break it up, then cook for about ten minutes, always stirring, until it sizzles and browns.
1. Add the wine; cook over medium heat until it has completely evaporated.
1. Add the tomato paste and purée. Mix well; add a cup of boiling stock (or water) and simmer, covered, for about 2 hours (or 3 depending on preference and type of meat), adding hot broth (or water) as needed. Add any milk (traditionally used) half way through the cooking; allow to evaporate completely.
1. Season with salt and pepper before serving. When ready the sauce will be a rich maroon hue, thick and glossy.

## Note

Traditionally, in Bologna hanger or skirt steak is used (the diaphragm of the beef, which is difficult to find today). In lieu or in addition, favour anterior cuts, rich in collagen, such as shoulder or chuck, brisket, plate or flank. Combinations are acceptable, as is the modern technique of browning the meat separately and then adding it to the softened minced vegetables in the pan.

## Permitted variants

-   Mixed beef and pork (about 60% beef)
-   Meat minced with a knife
-   Cured pancetta instead of fresh pancetta
-   A pinch of nutmeg

## Unacceptable variants

-   Veal
-   Smoked pancetta or bacon
-   Only pork
-   Garlic, rosemary, parsley or other herbs and spices
-   Brandy instead of wine
-   Flour as a thickening agent

## Ragù alla bolognese can be enriched with

-   Chicken livers, hearts and gizzards
-   Peeled and crumbled pork sausage
-   Blanched peas, added at the end of cooking
-   Dried porcini, rehydrated

## Ingredients

- 30 grams (2 tablespoons) extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed or finely chopped
- 800 grams (4 cups) canned whole plum tomatoes (like San Marzano)
- 5 grams (1 teaspoon) sugar, heaped
- 8 grams (1 teaspoon) salt, or more to taste
- Handful of basil leaves, roughly chopped
- Pinch of freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

1. Place the oil in a sauce pan over medium heat. When warm, add the garlic and cook until softened but not brown (not more than a minute).
2. Pour the can of plum tomatoes in the sauce pan and use a potato masher to break them apart and crush them down.
3. Add the remaining ingredients, then simmer on low heat for 45 minutes, or until the flavour has deepened and the sauce has thickened slightly. Adjust seasoning to taste.

## Notes

- This sauce can be used straight away, or placed in an airtight container and stored in the fridge for up to a week, ready to be used as required.

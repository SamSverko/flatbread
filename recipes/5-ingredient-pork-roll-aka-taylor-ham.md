## Ingredients

-   14 g unsalted butter (1 tablespoon)
-   2 slices Taylor ham (3 ounces; 85g)
-   2 large eggs
-   2 slices American cheese
-   1/4 tsp kosher salt
-   1 tsp ground black pepper
-   1 Kaiser roll, split and warmed through (see notes)
-   Ketchup, optional (but also mandatory)

## Directions

1. Line a plate with paper towel. In a 10-inch cast iron skillet set over medium heat, melt butter until foaming.
1. Add the pork slices and cook, pressing down once or twice with a spatula, until well browned around the edges and domed on top, about 3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until second side is well browned, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Transfer to prepared plate and set aside.
1. Gently slip eggs into the pan, season with salt, and cook until the whites are just set and bubbling, then flip, season with pepper and continue cooking until eggs are over-easy, about 2 minutes.
1. Place both slices of cheese on top of one of the eggs and continue to cook until eggs are over-medium, about 1 minute longer.
1. Stack the cheese-covered egg on top of the bare egg and transfer to a plate.
1. Dip Kaiser roll halves, cut side down, into the pan juices to lightly coat.
1. Set eggs on top of bottom half of roll, top with pork roll slices, and close sandwich. Wrap sandwich tightly in aluminum foil and let steam for at least 3 minutes and up to fiveâ€”the longer the steam, the softer the sandwich.
1. Serve with ketchup (if using), either alongside for dunking or on the sandwich itself, depending on preference.

## Notes

-   For the most efficient execution of the recipe, you can carefully wrap the kaiser roll in foil and heat in a low oven or toaster oven while cooking the pork and eggs. Then unwrap to dip the bread in the fat and assemble the sandwich before rewrapping.

## Ingredients

-   2 small garlic cloves, minced
-   1 teaspoon anchovy paste (see note)
-   2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, from one lemon
-   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard (I like the brand Maille)
-   1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
-   1 cup mayonnaise, best quality such as Hellmann's Real
-   ½ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
-   ¼ teaspoon salt
-   ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the garlic, anchovy paste, lemon juice, Dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce. Add the mayonnaise, Parmigiano-Reggiano, salt and pepper and whisk until well combined. Taste and adjust to your liking. The dressing will keep well in the fridge for about a week.

## Ingredients

-   450 g lean ground pork
-   2 cups chopped cilantro
-   1 ½ cups finely chopped Chinese chives, or green onions
-   2 tbsp minced fresh ginger
-   1 tbsp Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
-   1 tbsp sodium-reduced soy sauce
-   1 tbsp sesame oil
-   2 tsp granulated sugar
-   1 tsp salt
-   ½ tsp white or black pepper
-   Pinch hot pepper flakes (optional)
-   68 round dumpling wrappers (approximately)
-   Canola oil, if frying

## Directions

1. In large bowl, stir together pork, cilantro, chives, ginger, rice wine, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, salt, white pepper, and hot pepper flakes (if using).
1. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Place bowl of water on work surface. Using finger, brush edge of 1 dumpling wrapper with water. Place heaping 1 tsp pork mixture in centre of wrapper; fold dough over to line up edges.
1. Pinch and fold edge into pleats to seal; press lightly to flatten bottom. Place dumpling seam side up on prepared pan; cover with damp towel. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.
1. To steam in batches: Pour enough water into wok to allow for steamer basket; bring to boil. Line parchment paper; arrange dumplings seam side up in basket, without touching another.
1. Carefully place steamer in wok; cover and steam, adding more water to wok as needed, until dumplings are firm and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Repeat with remaining dumplings.
1. To fry in batches, pot sticker-style: In large nonstick skillet, heat 2 tsp canola oil over medium-high heat; arrange dumplings seam side up in pan, without touching one another.
1. Cook until bottoms are light brown, about 1 minutes. Pour in enough water to come ¼ inch up side of pan. Cover and reduce heat to medium; cook without turning until dumplings are translucent and almost no liquid remains, 5 to 6 minutes.
1. Uncover and increase heat to medium-high; cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides and no liquid remains, about 5 minutes.

## Notes

-   Omit green onion; cover and store in refrigerator for up to three days, adding green onion just before serving.

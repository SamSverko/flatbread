## Ingredients

-   4 chicken breasts
-   4 tbsp mayonnaise
-   1 cup panko breadcrumbs
-   320 g sweet bell peppers
-   113 g red onion
-   1 cup marinara sauce
-   ½ cup parmesan cheese, shredded
-   113 g baby spinach
-   2 tbsp red wine vinegar
-   2 tbsp Italian seasoning
-   3 tsp dijon mustard
-   1 tsp sugar
-   Oil
-   Salt and pepper

## Directions

1.  1. Core, then cut pepper into ¼-inch slices. Peel, then cut the onion into ¼-inch slices. Add panko to a shallow dish. Pat chicken dry with paper towels.
1.  Carefully slice into the centre of each chicken breast, parallel to the cutting board, leaving ½-inch intact on the other end. Open up chicken like a book. Season both sides with salt, pepper and half the Italian seasoning.
1.  Coat each breast all over with mayo. Working one breast at a time, press into panko to coat completely.
1.  Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. When hot, add 1 tbsp oil, then chicken. Pan-fry until golden-brown, 3-4 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a foil-lined baking sheet. Carefully wipe pan clean.
1.  Spoon marinara sauce over chicken, then sprinkle with parmesan. Broil in the middle of the oven until cheese is golden-brown and chicken is cooked through, 4-6 minutes.
1.  While chicken broils, heat the same pan over medium-high. When hot, add 1 tbsp oil, then onions and remaining Italian seasoning. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 3-4 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool slightly.
1.  While onions cook, whisk together dijon, vinegar ½ tsp sugar and 2 tbsp oil in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
1.  Add spinach, peppers and onions to the bowl with dressing. Toss to combine. Divide chicken parmigiana and salad between plates.

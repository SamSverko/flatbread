1. Mix corn starch, potato starch, and room temperature water together until combined and work the dough until it is smooth, approx. 2 minutes.
1. With a knife, divide into 16 pieces, roll each piece into 6 inch long pieces.
1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil, and add the noodles in. Be sure to be gentle as the noodles are delicate before they are cooked.
1. When the noodles begin to float, notice the change in color and texture. They will swell, so be sure to stir the water to keep them from sticking.
1. Test a noodle, by tasting it, once it is clear/opaque. When the noodles have finished cooking, strain and toss in sauce.

### Chili garlic sauce 1

1. In a small sauce pot or sauté pan, heat vegetable oil until it is very hot.
1. Combine all ingredients except oil in a large heat proof bowl.

1. Strain the mixture, reserving the liquid, into a blender
1. Starting on the low setting, begin to blend the mixture. Use the reserved liquid to loosen the mixture, until it begins to move freely. Then blend on high to a purée.
1. In the blender, pour a small stream of oil into the mixture to emulsify.
1. Pour the finished sauce in a bowl that will be used to toss the noodles.

## Ingredients

-   3/4 cup all-purpose flour
-   1 cup unsweetened alkalized cocoa powder (we use valhrona)
-   3/4 pound (3 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into 1-tablespoon pieces
-   1 teaspoon kosher salt
-   3 large eggs
-   1 3/4 cups granulated sugar
-   1/2 teaspoon vanilla paste
-   6 ounces 61 to 64% chocolate, chopped into chip-sized pieces ( about 1 1/2 cups)
-   Powdered sugar for dusting

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350F.
1. At Ad Hoc, they use a 9-inch square silicone mold, because it keeps the edges from overcooking; if you use a metal or glass baking pan, butter and flour it. Set aside.
1. Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt; set aside
1. Melt half the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Put the remaining butter in a medium bowl. Pour the melted butter and stir to melt the butter. The butter should look creamy, with small bits of unmelted butter, and be at room temperature.
1. In a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle, mix together the eggs and sugar on medium speed for about 3 minutes, or until thick and very pale. Mix in the vanilla. On low speed, add about one-third of the dry ingredients, then add one-third of the butter, and continue alternating the remaining flour and butter.
1. Add the chocolate and mix to combine. (The batter can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.)
1. Spread the batter evenly in the pan. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a cake tester or wooden skewer poked into the center comes out with just a few moist crumbs sticking to it. If the pick comes out wet, test a second time, because you may have hit a piece of chocolate chip; then bake for a few more minutes longer if necessary.
1. Cool in the pan until the brownie is just a bit warmer than room temperature. Run a knife around the edges if not using a silicone mold, and invert the brownie onto a cutting board. Cut into 12 rectangles. Dust the tops with powdered sugar just before serving. (The brownies can be stored in an airtight container for up to 2 days.)

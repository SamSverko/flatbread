## Ingredients

-   450 g beef flank marinating steak (¾-inch thick)
-   5 tbsp canola oil
-   5 tsp Montreal steak spice
-   4 tsp each chili powder and ground cumin
-   3 cloves garlic, minced
-   1 (450 g) package mini sweet peppers
-   1 red onion, cut in ½-inch wedges
-   1 sweet potato, cut in ¾-inch cubes
-   1 bunch broccolini
-   ¼ cup red wine vinegar
-   8 cups mixed baby greens
-   2 cups watercress
-   1 avodaco, sliced
-   1 lime, cut in wedges

## Directions

1. Position racks in top third (6 inches from the top) and centre of oven; preheat to 450°F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper.
1. Place steak on separate baking sheet. In small bowl, combine oil, steak spice, chili powder, cumin, and garlic. Drizzle 2 tbsp of the steak spice mixture over steak, turning to coat; let stand at room temperature.
1. On prepared pan, toss together sweet peppers, red onion, sweet potato, and remaining spice mixture; arrange in single layer. Roast in centre of oven for 15 minutes. Flip vegetables; stir in Broccolini. Roast until tender, about 5 minutes.
1. Move pan to top third of oven; broil until vegetables are slightly charred, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from oven. Drizzle with vinegar; toss to coat.
1. Broil steak, flipping halfway through, until medium-rare, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to cutting board; let rest for 10 minutes. Slice across the grain.
1. Divide baby greens, watercress, avocado, vegetable mixture, steak, and lime wedges among bowls.

## Notes

-   If you can’t find flank steak, any boneless grilling steak, such as top sirloin, strip loin, or rib steak will work. Let the meat become room temperature; pat dry with paper towels before cooking.

-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1/4 teaspoon pepper
-   1.5 kg boneless beef blade roast cut in 1-inch (2.5 cm cubes)
-   3 tablespoons butter
-   1 tablespoon vegetable oil
-   2 ribs celery diced
-   1 onion diced
-   2 tablespoons tomato paste
-   1/2 cup dry red wine
-   450 g mini white potatoes scrubbed and quartered
-   3 large carrots cut in 1 1/2-inch thick (4 cm) chunks (halve bigger pieces)
-   10 sprigs fresh thyme
-   6 sprigs fresh parsley
-   2 bay leaves
-   3 cups sodium-reduced beef broth
-   1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
-   3/4 cups pickled cocktail onions drained and rinsed
-   3/4 cups frozen peas

## Directions

1. In large bowl, whisk together flour, salt and pepper; toss with beef to coat.
1. In large Dutch oven, heat 2 tbsp of the butter and the oil over medium heat; working in small batches, cook beef, stirring, until browned, about 20 minutes total. Using slotted spoon, remove to bowl; set aside.
1. Add remaining butter to Dutch oven; cook celery and onion over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomato paste; cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add wine; cook, stirring and scraping up browned bits, for 2 minutes.
1. Return beef and any juices to Dutch oven. Add potatoes, carrots, thyme, parsley and bay leaves. Stir in broth and Worcestershire sauce; bring to boil, stirring occasionally to loosen any remaining browned bits from bottom.
1. Cover and braise in 350 F (180 C) oven for 45 minutes. Stir in cocktail onions; cover and braise for 15 minutes. Uncover and cook until vegetables are tender and beef offers no resistance when pierced with tip of knife, 30 to 40 minutes. Stir in peas; cook for 5 minutes.
1. Skim any fat from surface of stew; remove thyme, parsley and bay leaves. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
1. **Change it up - The Ultimate Beef and Mushroom Stew:** In large Dutch oven, melt 1 tbsp butter over medium heat; cook 1 pkg (227 g) button or cremini mushrooms, trimmed, stirring occasionally, until tender, golden and no liquid remains, about 7 minutes. Using slotted spoon, remove to bowl; set aside. Continue with recipe as directed, returning mushrooms to Dutch oven along with beef.

## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ¼ teaspoon smoked paprika
- ½ cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, (from about 1 bunch of parsley, coarse stems removed)

## Directions

1. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, garlic, salt, oregano, red pepper flakes, and smoked paprika. Stir in the parsley. Alternatively, you could combine the ingredients in a mortar and pestle or with a few pulses in a food processor.
1. Season to taste and serve as a sauce over roasted or grilled vegetables.

## Notes

- Similar to pesto, chimichurri can be stored in the freezer in ice cube trays. When ready to use, let thaw at room temp.

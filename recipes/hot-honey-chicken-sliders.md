## Directions

1. To the bowl of a food processor or blender, add peppers, vinegar and garlic. Pulse until a medium coarse consistency is achieved.
2. In a medium pot over medium heat, add honey and chopped pepper mixture. Bring to a boil and cook until reduced by half. Taste and adjust with vinegar and salt as needed.
3. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Add chicken thighs to a casserole dish and season both sides with salt and pepper. Drizzle a bit of oil over the top and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the skin begins to turn golden brown. Add the agrodulce over the top and bake for another 5 minutes, or until the sauce becomes sticky and reduced.
4. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes.
5. Add chicken to the rolls, topping the chicken with toasted sesame seeds and more pickled peppers, if desired.

## Ingredients

-   4 large eggs
-   2/3 cup milk
-   1/4 cup all-purpose flour
-   1/4 cup granulated sugar
-   1/4 teaspoon salt
-   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
-   8 thick slices bread

## Directions

1. Preheat griddle to 350 degrees F or or heat a skillet over medium heat.
1. Add all ingredients, except the bread, to a blender or to a shallow dish and whisk well to combine. If whisking by hand, mix flour and eggs together first, then add remaining ingredients.
1. Dip bread slices into the batter, dredging them well on both sides, and place on hot, greased griddle or skillet.
1. Cook for a few minutes, until the bottom of the breads starts to get golden brown. Flip and cook on the other side the same.
1. Remove to a plate. Serve warm with syrup and a sprinkle of powdered sugar.

## Notes

-   **Bread:** I like to use thick sliced bread, like Sara Lee Artesano, Texas Toast, or leftover homemade bread. It's nice (but not necessary) if the bread is a few days old, or slightly stale. Even try using cinnamon toast, or brioche!
-   **Flour:** My Secret Ingredient! The flour helps to make more of a "batter" for dipping the bread, which yields extra fluffy and delicious french toast.
-   **Milk:** Any kind of milk will work (even dairy free), but the the higher fat milk, the creamier the batter will be. Whole milk works great and you could even add a little splash of cream if you want.
-   **Make Ahead Instructions:** The batter can be made 1-2 days ahead of time, depending on the freshness of your ingredients.
-   **Freezing Instructions:** Allow french toast to cool completely and store in a freezer-safe bag or container for up to 3 months. Rewarm on a skillet, in the toaster, or for a few seconds in the microwave.

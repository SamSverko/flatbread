## Ingredients

-   Kosher salt
-   1 pound (450g) dried spaghetti
-   1/2 cup (120ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided
-   4 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced
-   Red pepper flakes, to taste (optional)
-   Minced flat-leaf parsley, for serving (optional)

## Directions

1. In a pot of salted boiling water, cook spaghetti until just shy of al dente (about 1 minute less than the package directs). Reserve pasta cooking water.
1. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, combine 6 tablespoons oil and garlic. Add pinch of red pepper flakes, if using. Cook over medium heat until garlic is very lightly golden, about 5 minutes. (Adjust heat as necessary to keep it gently sizzling.)
1. Transfer pasta to skillet along with 1/2 cup pasta water, increase heat to high, and cook, stirring and tossing rapidly, until a creamy, emulsified sauce forms and coats the noodles. Remove from heat, add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, and stir well to combine. Mix in parsley, if using, and serve right away.

## Ingredients

### For the Marinade

-   2 1/4 cups (533ml) dry red Italian wine (preferably Chianti or other Tuscan wine)
-   3 medium garlic cloves (15g), smashed
-   1 tablespoon kosher salt
-   1 tablespoon dried juniper berries
-   1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns
-   2 dried bay leaves
-   1 rack (2.5 to 3 lbs; 1125 to 1350g) St. Louis–cut ribs, cut between bones into 3 equal pieces

### For the Ragù

-   2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided
-   2 carrots (about 4 ounces;115g), peeled and diced
-   2 celery stalks (about 4 ounces; 110g), diced
-   1 medium onion (about 8 ounces; 225g), diced
-   2 tablespoons (30g) tomato paste
-   4 medium garlic cloves (20g), minced
-   1 tablespoon (6g) chopped fresh sage
-   1 sprig fresh rosemary
-   2 cups (450g) crushed tomatoes or passata di pomodoro (see notes)
-   2 cups (450g) homemade chicken stock or low-sodium chicken broth

### For the Pappardelle

-   1 pound (450g) homemade fresh pasta dough, cut into 1- to 1 1/2–inch wide ribbons or store-bought fresh pappardelle
-   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

### For the Marinade

-   In a large bowl, mix together the wine, garlic, salt, juniper berries, peppercorns, and bay leaves. Add the rib pieces to the marinade, making sure they are fully submerged. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or up to 24 hours.

### For the Ragù

-   Remove ribs from marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Strain the marinade and discard solids. Set strained marinade aside.
-   In a large Dutch oven or deep sauté pan, heat 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches, brown the rib pieces, meaty side down, and cook until well browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer browned ribs to a clean plate and set aside.
-   In now-empty Dutch oven, add remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil and heat over medium heat until shimmering. Add carrots, celery, and onion, and cook stirring occasionally until the vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add tomato paste, garlic, sage, and rosemary and cook until the mixture is fragrant and the paste begins to brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in the reserved strained marinade, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until mixture is reduced slightly and thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and broth and return to a boil.
-   Nestle ribs and their juices, meaty side down, into the sauce, cover Dutch oven, reduce heat to low and cook until pork is fully tender and falls off the bones, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.
-   Remove and discard rosemary sprig. Transfer ribs to a clean plate and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Using 2 forks, shred meat, discard the bones, and return shredded meat to sauce. Simmer ragù over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until ragù is reduced to a saucy consistency, about 10 minutes.

### For the Pappardelle

-   In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta. If using fresh pasta, cook until noodles are barely cooked through. If using dry pasta, cook until just shy of al dente (1 to 2 minutes less than the package directs). Using tongs or a spider skimmer, transfer pasta to ragù in Dutch oven along with 1/2 cup (120ml) pasta cooking water. Alternatively, drain pasta using a colander or fine-mesh strainer, making sure to reserve at least 2 cups (500ml) pasta cooking water.
-   Return Dutch oven to medium-high heat and cook, stirring and tossing pasta until it is al dente and ragù clings to the noodles, about 1 minute. Add pasta cooking water in 1/4 cup (60ml) increments to thin sauce, if needed. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide pasta between individual serving bowls. Serve.

## Special Equipment

-   Large Dutch oven or deep sauté pan
-   Large pot

## Notes

-   Passata di pomodoro is a cooked tomato puree that can be made at home, or jarred versions can be found at most supermarkets.

## Make-Ahead and Storage

-   The ragù can be cooked (through step 6), cooled, and refrigerated in an air-tight container for up to 5 days, or frozen for up to 3 months. When reheating ragù, thin with water as needed to reach desired consistency.

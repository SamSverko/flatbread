## Ingredients

-   800 g medium ground beef
-   ½ tsp each salt and pepper
-   8 slices cheddar cheese
-   ⅓ cup The Ultimate Burger Sauce
-   4 double-decker burger buns (see note)
-   ½ cup finely chopped onion
-   2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce
-   16 rounds bread-and-butter pickles

## Directions

1. Divide beef evenly into 8 mounds; between parchment paper, flatten into 5-inch wide patties with bottom of heavy skillet. Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper.
1. In large cast-iron skillet, cook patties, 2 at a time, over medium-high heat, until bottoms are browned and lift easily from pan, about 1 minute; flip.
1. Top each patty with 1 slice of cheddar; cook until bottoms are browned, patties are cooked through and cheese is melted, about 1 minute.
1. Spread 1 tsp of the burger sauce onto bottom third of each bun; top with half of the onion and lettuce.
1. Layer 1 patty, 2 pickle rounds and middle thirds of buns over top; spread 1 tsp of the remaining burger sauce onto each.
1. Layer remaining onion, lettuce, patties, pickles and burger sauce over top; sandwich top thirds of buns.

## Notes

-   To make double-decker buns, cut whole burger buns into thirds horizontally, or trim the tops and bottoms off split buns to form the middle thirds needed for this recipe.
-   Flattening the patties with a heavy skillet gives you the perfect thickness, and the parchment paper prevents the meat from sticking to your work surface or pan. Gently peel off the parchment and transfer the patties using a large spatula.

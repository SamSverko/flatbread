## Ingredients

-   1 small carrot, grated
-   1 small red onion, halved
-   1 lb ground chicken
-   ¼ cup panko
-   ¼ cup hoisin sauce
-   1 tbsp peeled ginger, grated
-   4 tsp low-sodium soy sauce
-   3 tsp hot Asian chili sauce
-   ½ lb white mushrooms, thinly sliced
-   2 tsp toasted sesame oil
-   1 lime, juiced
-   4 whole-wheat sesame hamburger buns

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
1. Grate the carrot and ½ onion into a large bowl. Add the chicken, panko, 2 tbsp hoisin sauce, the ginger, 3 tsp soy sauce and 1 tsp chili sauce and mix until combined.
1. Shape the chicken mixture into 4 patties and place on the prepared baking sheet. Bake until cooked through, about 20 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, thinly slice the remaining ½ onion. Toss with the mushrooms, sesame oil, lime juice and the remaining 1 tsp soy sauce in a bowl. Mix the remaining 2 tbsp hoisin sauce and 2 tsp chili sauce with 1 tbsp water in another bowl.
1. Warm the hamburger buns in the oven. Serve the burgers on the buns with a drizzle of the hoisin-chili sauce and some of the mushroom mixture.

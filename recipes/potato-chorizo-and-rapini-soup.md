## Ingredients

-   half bunch rapini
-   1 tablespoon olive oil
-   1 onion chopped
-   3/4 cups chopped dry-cured chorizo sausages
-   700 g yellow-fleshed potatoes (about 5) peeled and cut in 1/2-inch (1 cm) cubes
-   4 cloves garlic minced
-   1 teaspoon sweet paprika
-   1/4 teaspoon hot pepper flakes
-   3 cups sodium-reduced chicken broth
-   4 teaspoons lemon juice
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   pinch pepper

## Directions

1. Trim 1/2 inch (1 cm) from ends of rapini stems; cut rapini crosswise into thirds, separating leaves and stems. Set aside.
1. In Dutch oven or large heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat oil over medium heat; cook onion and sausage, stirring often, until onion is beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Add potatoes; cook, stirring occasionally and adding up to 1/3 cup water as needed if potatoes begin to stick to bottom of pan, about 8 minutes.
1. Add garlic, paprika and hot pepper flakes; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in broth and 3 cups water; bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, in large saucepan of boiling water, cook rapini stems for 2 minutes. Stir in leaves; cook until stems are tender-crisp and leaves are wilted, about 1 minute. Drain. Stir rapini, lemon juice, salt and pepper into soup.

## Notes

-   **Tip from The Test Kitchen:** Prepping potatoes ahead of time? Submerge them in water after peeling their skins. That way, the flesh won't oxidize and turn brown.

## Ingredients

-   2 quarts (2L) cold water
-   1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon (15g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus more to taste; for table salt use half as much by volume or an equal amount by weight
-   4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 6 ounces/170g each)
-   1/2 cup (4 ounces; 115g) basil pesto, homemade or store-bought
-   1/2 cup (4 ounces; 115g) mayonnaise, homemade or store-bought
-   2 teaspoons (10ml) fresh lemon juice from 1 lemon
-   1/2 cup (4 ounces; 115g) oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained, blotted dry, and roughly chopped
-   Freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

1. In a large saucepan, combine water and salt, and stir to dissolve salt.
1. Add chicken and set over medium-high heat until water temperature registers between 150 and 160°F (65.5 to 71°C) on an instant-read thermometer; adjust heat to maintain water temperature in the 150–160°F range (It's okay if the temperature bounces around a little, but try to keep it above 150 and below 170°F.). Cook until thickest part of chicken registers 150°F (65.5°C) on an instant-read thermometer, 25 to 30 minutes.
1. Remove chicken and let rest until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes.
1. Using two forks or clean hands, shred chicken into bite-size pieces and set aside.
1. In a large bowl, stir together mayonnaise, pesto, and lemon juice until well combined.
1. Add reserved shredded chicken and sun-dried tomatoes and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve.

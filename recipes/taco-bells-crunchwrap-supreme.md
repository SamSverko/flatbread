## Ingredients

-   2 tablespoons neutral oil, divided
-   1 pound ground beef, 80/20
-   1/2 medium yellow onion, diced
-   2 tablespoons pickled jalapeños, chopped
-   1 can green chilies
-   1 tablespoon cayenne
-   2 teaspoons chili powder
-   1 teaspoon garlic powder
-   1 teaspoon cumin
-   ¼ cup water
-   Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste
-   8 large flour tortillas
-   4 tostada shells
-   1 (8 ounce) can nacho cheese sauce
-   Sour cream
-   1 small head iceberg lettuce, finely shredded
-   2 Roma tomatoes, deseeded and chopped
-   4 ounces colby jack cheese, grated

## Directions

1. In a large skillet over medium high heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil. Once shimmering, add onions and cook until translucent. Add ground beef and using a wooden spoon, break it up into small pieces.
1. Cook for 6-8 minutes, or until the ground beef is browned and no longer pink. Add cayenne, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, salt and pepper and cook until spices are fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Remove skillet from the heat and set aside.
1. Stack 4 flour tortillas on top of each other and place a tostada in the middle. Using a small knife, trace around the outside of the tostada to create 4 smaller tortilla rounds. Set aside the smaller rounds.
1. Using the uncut tortillas, build the crunchwraps. Add 3 tablespoons of beef mixture in the middle of 1 tortilla. Drizzle nacho cheese sauce over the beef, then top with a tostada shell. Top the shell with sour cream, spreading it out evenly to the edges. Top with lettuce, tomato, and colby jack cheese. Top with the small cut tortilla and fold the edges of the large tortilla into the middle, creating pleats on the side.
1. Working quickly, invert the Crunchwraps so they stay together. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
1. In the same skillet over medium-low heat, add remaining oil. Once shimmering, add the Crunchwrap, seam side down. Cook until the wrap is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from the skillet and transfer to a serving platter. Repeat the cooking process with other wraps.

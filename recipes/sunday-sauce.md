## Ingredients

- Giant heap of meat suitable for braising (fatty cuts that you have to cook low and slow), such as, pork ribs, italian sausages, lamb leg, beef roast, beef ox tail (or anything with bone marrow). If you want chicken, go with whole, dark meat pieces, like a leg.
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 1 large carrot, chopped
- 3-4 garlic cloves, chopped
- 2 cans of crushed tomatoes
- 1 can of whole tomatoes
- Red wine of your choice (such as Chianti, Merlot, or Cabernet Sauvignon)
- Dried italian herbs (basil, oregano, marjoram, rosemary, thyme, red pepper flakes)
- Optional: Vinegar and sugar for end results seasoning
- Garnish: Fresh basil

## Directions

1. Set oven racks to middle and preheat oven to 300°F.
1. Heat a large, oven-safe, dutch oven on medium-high heat.
1. Add oil and sear all your meat. Season the meat with salt and pepper as you sear them. Set seared meat aside and work in batches, careful to not scortch the pan.
1. Reduce heat to medium and add onions and carrots. Saute until you get some nice golden browning on the pieces.
1. Add garlic and saute for 1 minute.
1. Add the tomatoes. Rinse out the cans and add water. Add a nice glug of red wine.
1. Add the italian herbs, add some salt, and stir to combine.
1. Add meat to the sauce, trying to submerge everything. Add more water if needed.
1. Cover and place in oven. You can place a cookie sheet underneath to catch any spill over.
1. Leave in all day, once meat is fork tender, usually around 4-6 hours.
1. Remove from oven, then remove all meat and set them on a heat-proof tray.
1. Season to taste with vinegar and sugar.
1. Optional: Place meat tray in oven and crank heat to highest setting to develop crusts.
1. Cook some pasta, and serve! You can shred all the meat and add back to sauce, or just add chunks to servings.

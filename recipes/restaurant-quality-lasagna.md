### Sauce

-   Canola oil
-   2 lbs boneless country-style pork rib, cut into 1-inch cubes
-   4 italian sausages, removed from casing
-   2 medium yellow onions, diced
-   2 medium carrots, diced
-   2 ribs celery, diced
-   4 cloves garlic, minced
-   2 cups dry white wine
-   Bunch of basil, in a boquet garnis
-   More basil for sauce seasoning
-   3 769ml cans crushed peeled tomatoes, or whole peeled tomatoes, crushed with a potato masher
-   Kosher salt
-   Black pepper

### Assembly

-   Dry lasagna pasta, they don't need to be oven-ready/no-boil
-   1 cup Precorino romano cheese, finely shredded
-   1 cup Parmesan cheese, finely shredded
-   3 cups Low-moisture mozzarella, shredded
-   1 cup ricotta cheese, optional

## Directions

### Sauce

1. Heat canola oil in a large dutch oven over medium-high heat.
1. Season pork ribs with some kosher salt. Add pork to the pan and brown on all sides, 5-7 minutes.
1. Once pork is nicely browned, remove from dutch oven using a slotted spoon into a bowl and set aside.
1. Add sausage to the dutch oven. Cook and break apart until mostly cooked and nicely browned. Turn heat down to medium. Remove sausage from dutch oven with slotted spoon and add to bowl with pork.
1. Add onions to the dutch oven and season with some kosher salt and saute. Once sizzling occurs, add the carrots and celery. Saute and stir frequently, until softened.
1. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about a minute.
1. Add white wine to the dutch oven and cook alcohol off. Add basil to sauce.
1. Increase heat to medium and add tomatoes to the sauce. Add some water to each can to rise and pour that into the sauce. Season with pepper, salt, and red chili flakes.
1. Once the sauce starts to bubble, add meats to sauce and lower heat to medium-low. Let it cook low and slow for at least 1.5 hours.
1. Remove basil. Remove pork using tongs into a bowl and shred the pork into bite size pieces. Add pork back to sauce.
1. Shred some basil into the sauce.
1. If the sauce is took thick, add some water to loosen a little.

### Assembly

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
1. Assemble each layer so the ingredients evenly coat the entire surface of the layer beneath.
1. When adding sauce on pasta, ensure sauce is completely covering the pasta. This will help them cook.
1. When adding pasta, press down to compress the lasagna a bit.
1. When adding cheeses, add as much pecorino, parmesan, and mozzarella as desired, but lightly dollop the ricotta. Don't add ricotta to top layer.
1. Layering order: sauce > pasta > sauce > cheeses.
1. Add as many layers that your dish will fit. The top layer should be cheese.
1. When layering is done, place lasagna dish on a large baking sheet. This will help catch any overflowing spills as it cooks.
1. Cover lasagna with tin foil.
1. Bake for 30 minutes. Then remove tin foil and bake for another 30 minutes.
1. When done, let it rest for at least 30 minutes! Otherwise it will be a sloppy mess.

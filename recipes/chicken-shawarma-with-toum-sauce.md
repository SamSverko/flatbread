## Directions

### Chicken Shawarma

1. In a large bowl, combine all spice mixes. Mix well.
1. Add olive oil, white vinegar, lemon juice, and tomato paste to spice mixture. Mix well. Set aside.
1. Slice chicken thighs into half-inch strips.
1. Add chicken thight to spice mixture. Mix well. Marinate overnight or for a few hours.

### Toum Sauce

1. In a large container, add garlic, a hefty pinch of salt, and about half of the neutral oil.
1. Blend together. Then add the rest of the neutral oil, continuing to blend until it emulsifies into a nice, creamy texture. Adjust garlic and/or oil amount until desired consistency.
1. Store in fridge.

### Chicken Shawarma (cont.)

1. Heat a large cast-iron (or stainless steel) pan over medium-high heat.
1. Cook the chicken in batches! Overcrowding the pan will result in the chicken steaming, rather than charring and crisping. Try not to toss them too much at first to allow them to crisp up.
1. Optional, but if you want a smokey flavour, grab a small heat-proof bowl and line it with tin foil. Add a bit of olive oil. Then add this to the center of the pan with cooking chicken. Add a lit natural charcoal to the small bowl with olive oil and quickly cover the pan. Let sit for 5-10 minutes.
1. Set the cooked chicken aside.
1. Optional, now would be a good time to heat up the pitas. Steaming them allows them to be malleable.
1. Assemble your chicken shawarma with the toum sauce and any toppings you'd like.

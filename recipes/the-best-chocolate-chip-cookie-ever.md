## Ingredients

- 1 cup salted butter softened
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup light brown sugar packed
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 2 cups chocolate chips (12 oz)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius). Line three baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
1. In a medium bowl mix flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
1. Cream together butter and sugars until combined.
1. Beat in eggs and vanilla until light (about 1 minute).
1. Mix in the dry ingredients until combined.
1. Add chocolate chips and mix well.
1. Roll 2-3 Tablespoons (depending on how large you like your cookies) of dough at a time into balls and place them evenly spaced on your prepared cookie sheets.
1. Bake in preheated oven for approximately 8-10 minutes. Take them out when they are just barely starting to turn brown.
1. Let them sit on the baking pan for 5 minutes before removing to cooling rack.

## Notes

1. Do not over bake
1. When you remove the cookies from the oven they will still look doughy. This is the secret that makes these cookies so absolutely amazing! Please, I beg you, do not over bake!

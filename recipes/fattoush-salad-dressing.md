## Ingredients

-   ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil
-   ¼ cup apple cider vinegar
-   4 tbsp lemon juice
-   1 ½ tsp salt
-   1 tsp sumac
-   ½ tsp garlic powder
-   ½ tsp oregano
-   ½ tsp parsley
-   ½ tsp pepper

## Directions

1. Combine all ingredients in a bowl, or some other container to store the dressing.

## Notes

-   Due to the extra-virgin olive oil, the dressing will solidify in the fridge. Remove from fridge 15 minutes before use or run the dressing under warm water.

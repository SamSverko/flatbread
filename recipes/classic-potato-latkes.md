## Ingredients

-   2 large Russet potatoes (about 1 pound), scrubbed and cut lengthwise into quarters
-   1 large onion (227 g), peeled and cut into quarters
-   2 large eggs
-   ½ cup all-purpose flour
-   2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt (or 1 teaspoon fine sea salt), plus more for sprinkling
-   1 teaspoon baking powder
-   ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
-   Safflower or other oil, for frying

## Directions

1. Using a food processor with a coarse grating disc, grate the potatoes and onion. Transfer the mixture to a clean dishtowel and squeeze and wring out as much of the liquid as possible.
1. Working quickly, transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Add the eggs, flour, salt, baking powder and pepper, and mix until the flour is absorbed.
1. In a medium heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat, pour in about ¼ inch of the oil. Once the oil is hot (a drop of batter placed in the pan should sizzle), use a heaping tablespoon to drop the batter into the hot pan, cooking in batches.
1. Use a spatula to flatten and shape the drops into discs. When the edges of the latkes are brown and crispy, about 5 minutes, flip. Cook until the second side is deeply browned, about another 5 minutes.
1. Transfer the latkes to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and sprinkle with salt while still warm. Repeat with the remaining batter.

## Directions

### For the Campechana

1. Preheat the oven to broil and line a sheet tray with foil. Add poblanos and jalapenos to the tray and broil until completely charred.
2. Remove from the oven and place in a medium heat-safe bowl and cover with a plate. Allow to steam for a few minutes, then once they have cooled a bit, remove the skin. Roughly chop peppers and add to a large mixing bowl.
3. To the large mixing bowl, add chilled seafood, tomato juice, clam juice, tomato, onion, garlic, oregano, cilantro, lime juice and olive oil. Gently stir to combine.
4. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Season with salt if needed.

### For the Taco Filling

1. Add potatoes to a medium saucepan and cover potatoes with cold water. Season with salt and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until tender. Drain potatoes, mash them and set aside.
2. In a large skillet, add onion and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until lightly browned around the edges. Add tomato and cook for 2-3 minutes or until tomatoes have lightly cooked down and released moisture. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute, or until fragrant. Then add shrimp, cumin, coriander and chili powder. Stir to combine and cook for 2 minutes, or until the shrimp is opaque.
3. Remove from the heat and add reserved potatoes and mix to combine. Allow the mixture to slightly cool, then add mozzarella cheese and stir again to combine.
4. Once the mixture is cool enough to handle, preheat ½ cup vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
5. Form taco mixture into patties and add to half of the tortilla. Fold over to form a half moon, then repeat with the remaining tortillas. Once the oil is shimmering, add tacos, working in batches if needed. Cook for TKTK minutes, or until tacos are golden brown on each side.
6. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate.

### For Serving

1. Top tacos with Campechana, hot sauce and additional cilantro.

## Ingredients

-   2 teaspoons olive oil
-   1 onion diced
-   1 carrots halved lengthwise and thinly sliced crosswise
-   1 rib celery chopped
-   1 clove garlic minced
-   1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
-   1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper
-   1 pkg (900 ml) sodium-reduced chicken broth
-   2 boneless skinless chicken breasts about 500 g total
-   2 cups broad egg noodles such as No Yolks
-   1/4 cup whipping cream 35%
-   3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
-   1 cup frozen peas
-   3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

## Directions

1. In Dutch oven or large heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat oil over medium heat; cook onion, carrot, celery, garlic, thyme, salt and pepper, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 8 minutes.
1. Add broth and chicken; bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 2 minutes. Stir in noodles; cover and simmer until chicken is no longer pink inside and noodles are al dente, about 9 minutes.
1. Remove chicken breasts to cutting board. Using 2 forks, shred into bite-size pieces.
1. In small bowl, whisk together cream, flour and 1 cup water until smooth. Whisk into soup; bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir in chicken and peas; simmer for 1 minute. Stir in parsley.

## Notes

-   **Tip from The Test Kitchen:** Read the package instructions when buying the egg noodles. You'll want noodles that take about 12 minutes to cook so that they're done at the same time as the chicken.

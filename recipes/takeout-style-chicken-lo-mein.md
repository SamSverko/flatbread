## Ingredients

-   ¼ cup tamari soy sauce
-   2 tbsp Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
-   1 ½ tsp cornstarch
-   1 tsp granulated sugar
-   1 ¼ kosher salt, plus more for cooking the noodles
-   1 medium boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 227 g)
-   227 g dried lo mein or udon noodles
-   3 tbsp vegetable oil, divided
-   ½ medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
-   113 g snow peas or sugar snap peas, halved on a slight diagonal
-   1 medium red bell pepper, thinly sliced
-   1 clove garlic, minced
-   1 scallion, thinly sliced (optional)

## Directions

1. Make the sauce and marinade: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
1. Meanwhile, place the soy sauce, wine or sherry, cornstarch, sugar, and remaining ¼ tsp salt in a small bowl and whisk until the cornstarch is dissolved. Transfer 2 tbsp of the sauce to a medium bowl.
1. Cut the chicken breast in half horizontally (also known as butterflying), then cut crosswise into thin strips. Place the chicken in the medium bowl and toss to coat; set the marinated chicken and the remaining sauce aside.
1. Cook the noodles and vegetables: Add the noodles to the boiling water and cook according to package directions.
1. Meanwhile, heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium-high until shimmering. Add the onion, season with salt, and cook until starting to brown, 3 to 4 minutes.
1. Add the snow peas or snap peas, bell pepper, and garlic and stir-fry until crisp tender, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate; set aside.
1. When the noodles are ready, drain in a colander and run under cold water until cooled. Set aside to drain while you cook the chicken.
1. Heat the remaining 2 tbsp oil in the skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the chicken and spread into a single layer. Sear undisturbed until the chicken is golden-brown on the bottom, 1 ½ to 2 minutes.
1. Stir-fry until just cooked through, about 1 minute more.
1. Add the noodles and reserved vegetables. Cook, tossing with tongs, until heated through, about 2 minutes. Whisk the sauce again to recombine and dissolve the cornstarch, then add to the pan.
1. Toss until the sauce evenly coats the noodles and vegetables. Garnish with the scallions if desired and serve.

## Notes

-   **Make ahead:** The vegetables and chicken can be cut and refrigerated up to 1 day ahead.
-   **Storage:** Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days.
-   **Using chicken thighs:** Boneless, skinless chicken thighs can be substituted for chicken breast. Skip butterflying the thighs and just thinly slice them instead.

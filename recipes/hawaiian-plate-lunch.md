## Ingredients

### Mac Salad

-   1 pound dry elbow macaroni
-   1 small sweet yellow onion, grated
-   2 cups Hellman’s mayonnaise
-   ¼ cup whole milk
-   2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
-   2 teaspoons sugar
-   ½ teaspoon white pepper
-   1 medium carrot, peeled and grated

### Pork Chops

-   5 bone-in, center cut pork chops (¾ inch thick)
-   1 cup flour
-   ½ cup cornstarch
-   1 tablespoon garlic powder
-   Kosher salt and black pepper
-   Vegetable oil, for frying

## Pico

-   2 plum tomatoes, chopped
-   ¼ sweet yellow onion, chopped

## Serving

-   White rice, cooked

## Directions

### Mac Salad

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook past al dente, until the noodles are swollen, about 2-3 minutes over the package directions. Drain and set aside.
1. Over a large mixing bowl, grate the onion on the second largest holes, making sure to catch both the grated onion and the juice. Add the mayonnaise, milk, vinegar, sugar and white pepper to the bowl and whisk to combine. Add grated carrot and fold together. Taste and adjust with sugar, salt and vinegar as needed.
1. Then add the macaroni and stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate.

### Pork Chops

1. In a large, deep skillet add 1 inch of oil over medium heat.
1. In a wide, shallow bowl or plate, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, and garlic powder. Season the pork chops on both sides with salt and pepper. Press each pork chop into the flour mixture, coating it well on both sides.
1. Add the pork chops to the preheated oil and cook for 3-5 minutes per side, or until the edges begin to brown. Because of the cornstarch, the pork will not turn golden brown like fried chicken.
1. Transfer to a sheet tray lined with paper towels and allow to rest a few minutes before slicing.

### Serving

1. Add 1 scoop of rice, 1 scoop of macaroni salad, 1 sliced pork chop and a generous amount of pico on the side.

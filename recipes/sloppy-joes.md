## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 ½ pounds ground beef (80/20)
- ½ green bell pepper
- ½ red bell pepper
- 1 small yellow onion
- 1 jalapeño
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire
- 1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons chili powder
- ½ teaspoon mace
- 1 ½ teaspoons paprika
- 3 tablespoons yellow mustard
- ½ cup ketchup
- ½ cup tomato sauce
- Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste
- 4 sesame seed buns, toasted

## Directions

1. In a large, deep skillet over medium high heat, add oil.
2. Once shimmering, add ground beef. Using a wooden spoon, break the ground meat up into small pieces and cook for 6-8 minutes, or until golden brown.
3. Add peppers and onions and stir to combine. Cook for 6-8 minutes, or until the peppers and onions are soft and the edges are lightly golden brown.
4. Next, add the tomato paste and stir to combine into the meat mixture. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently, or until the tomato paste darkens in color.
5. Add Worcestershire sauce, Dijon, brown sugar and garlic powder. Stir to combine. Then add tomato sauce and salt and pepper to taste. Stir to combine and cook for 30-60 minutes, or until the sauce is slightly reduced and the flavors marry.
6. Spoon a generous amount of the meat mixture onto the toasted buns. Top with diced onions and pickles.

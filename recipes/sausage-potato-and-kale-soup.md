## Ingredients

-   1lb smoked beef sausage, kielbasa, or andouille sausage, sliced into coins
-   1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped
-   4-6 cloves minced fresh garlic
-   1 to 2 heaped teaspoons sweet smoked paprika
-   4 medium potatoes, cubed (or 4-6 cups cauliflower florets for those watching carbs)
-   32 ounces no sodium chicken bone broth (I buy these in bulk to always have on hand)
-   2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream or half & half
-   4 cups roughly chopped tuscan or curly kale
-   lots of fresh ground black pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Bring a large heavy bottomed saucepan to medium heat. Add the sliced sausage directly without any oil, it’ll render its own oil. Sauté for 2-3 minutes until golden then add onion and garlic, stirring and cooking for 5 minutes until onions are translucent and garlic fragrant.
1. Add 1 heaped teaspoon smoked paprika, potatoes and bone broth. Place the lid on and cook for 15-20 minutes until the potatoes are cooked through and soft enough to mash a few with the back of a fork. This will thicken the soup up a bit, so have some more stock ready if you feel it’s not soupy enough. Taste and adjust the amount of smoked paprika, adding up to 1 heaped teaspoon more.
1. Add the kale and heavy cream, lower heat and simmer for 2-3 minutes until kale is wilted. Divide amongst your family and serve with some fresh black pepper tableside.

## Instant Pot Method

1. Set your Instant Pot to sauté. Cook sliced sausage for 2-3 minutes until golden. Add onion and garlic, stir and sauté for another 5 minutes until onions are translucent and garlic fragrant. If the bottom of your pot becomes too dry, add a few tablespoons of water to loosen things up.
1. Add smoked paprika, potatoes and bone broth to the inner pot. Place the lid on and set your Instant Pot to 6 minutes high pressure. Once cooking is complete, release pressure and stir in kale. Simmer for 2-3 minutes while stirring to wilt the kale and break up some of the potatoes - This will thicken the soup slightly. Ladle into bowls and serve with freshly cracked black pepper.

## Ingredients

-   2 tbsp olive oil
-   1 onion, chopped
-   2 cloves garlic, minced
-   1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and chopped
-   1 tsp chili powder
-   2 tsp ground cumin
-   ¼ tsp salt
-   3 cups no-salt-added vegetable broth
-   2x 540 ml cans black beans, drained, and rinsed

## Directions

1. In large pot, heat oil over medium heat; cook onion, garlic, and jalapeño pepper until softened, 5 to 6 minutes.
1. Add chili powder, cumin, and salt; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in broth, scraping the bottom of the pot. Add beans; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook until vegetables and beans are tender, about 20 minutes.
1. Using immersion blender, purée soup until almost smooth with some whole beans remaining.

## Notes

-   The soup is the perfect base for your favourite taco toppings. Sprinkle with chopped avocado, sliced jalapeño pepper, shredded cheddar cheese, cilantro leaves, or broken tortilla chips.

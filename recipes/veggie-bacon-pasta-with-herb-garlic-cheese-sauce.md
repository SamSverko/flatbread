## Ingredients

-   1 bunch Broccolini, cut crosswise in thirds
-   1 zucchini, halved lengthwise and cut in ¾-inch thick pieces
-   1 small red onion, cut in ½-inch wedges
-   1 tbsp olive oil
-   ¼ tsp salt
-   4 strips bacon, chopped
-   225 g Italpasta large bow ties (about 2 ¾ cups)
-   1 (150 g) package soft herb-and-garlic cheese (such as Boursin), crumbled
-   2 tbsp finely chopped chives

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425°F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper.
1. Place Broccolini, zucchini, and red onion on prepared pan. Drizzle with oil; sprinkle with salt and ¼ tsp of the pepper, tossing to coat. Scatter bacon over vegetables. Bake, flipping halfway through, until vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, in large pot of boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions; reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid, drain. Return pasta to pot.
1. Add cheese, remaining ¼ tsp pepper and ½ cup of the reserved cooking liquid; stir until cheese is melted, adding more cooking liquid, as needed, to make thin sauce. Add vegetables to pot; stir to coat. Divide among bowls; sprinkle with chives.

## Notes

-   Always save some of the cooking liquid before draining pasta. When tossing the Italpasta with the sauce, add some of the cooking liquid to add body to the sauce and help it bind to the pasta.

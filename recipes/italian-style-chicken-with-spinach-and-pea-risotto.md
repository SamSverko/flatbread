## Ingredients

-   4 chicken breasts
-   113 g green peas
-   113 g baby spinach
-   226 g yellow onion
-   1 ½ cup Arborio rice
-   4 tbsp chicken broth concentrate
-   1 cup Parmesan cheese, shredded
-   2 tbsp chicken salt
-   2 garlic cloves
-   1 tbsp Italian seasoning
-   2 tbsp unsalted butter
-   ¼ tsp salt
-   ¼ tsp pepper
-   1 tbsp oil

## Directions

1. Before starting, preheat the oven to 425˚F. Wash and dry all produce. Combine 4 1/2 cups water (5 1/2 cups for 4 ppl), broth concentrates and 1/4 tsp salt (dbl for 4 ppl) in a medium pot.
1. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to low, still covered. While broth comes to a boil, peel, then cut onion into 1/4-inch pieces. Peel, then mince or grate garlic.
1. Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. When hot, add 1 tbsp butter (dbl for 4 ppl), then swirl the pan until melted. Add onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, 3-4 min. Add garlic. Cook, stirring often, until fragrant, 1 min.
1. Add rice. Cook, stirring often, until toasted, 1-2 min. Add 1 cup broth to the pan with rice. Cook, stirring occasionally, until broth is almost completely absorbed.
1. Repeat, adding 1 cup broth at a time, until texture is creamy and rice is tender, 28-30 min.
1. (TIP: The consistency should be similar to oatmeal!) Add peas with the last addition of broth. Season with half the chicken salt.
1. While risotto cooks, heat a medium non-stick pan over medium-high heat. While the pan heats, pat chicken dry with paper towels.
1. Season with pepper, half the Italian Seasoning (use all for 4 ppl) and remaining chicken salt. When hot, add 1/2 tbsp oil (dbl for 4 ppl), then chicken.
1. Cook until golden, 1-2 min per side. (NOTE: Don't overcrowd the pan; cook chicken in 2 batches if needed!) Transfer chicken to a parchment-lined baking sheet.
1. Sprinkle 1 tbsp Parmesan over each chicken breast. Bake in the middle of the oven until chicken is cooked through, 12-14 min.
1. When the last addition of broth is almost completely absorbed, add three-quarters of the remaining Parmesan, spinach, 1 tbsp butter (dbl for 4 ppl) and any juices from the baking sheet to the pan with risotto.
1. Cook, stirring often, until spinach wilts and cheese melts, 2-3 min.
1. (TIP: Add 1/4 cup water if the risotto is too thick!) Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
1. Thinly slice chicken. Divide risotto between plates. Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan. Arrange chicken over top.

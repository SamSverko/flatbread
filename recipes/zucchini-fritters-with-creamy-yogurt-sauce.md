## Ingredients

### Creamy Yogurt Sauce

- 1/2 cup (120g) plain Greek or regular yogurt (or sour cream)
- 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh mint
- 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh dill
- 1 Tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- 1 Tablespoon (15ml) olive oil
- 1 teaspoon honey
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- salt and fresh ground black pepper, to taste

### Fritters

- 3 cups (about 360g) shredded zucchini (2 medium zucchini, about 3/4–1 lb.)
- 1/3 cup (45g) finely chopped yellow onion
- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided
- 1 large egg
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 Tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh mint
- 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh dill
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/3 cup (40g) fine cornmeal
- 1 Tablespoon (8g) cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 3 Tablespoons (45ml) olive oil

## Directions

1. **Make the yogurt sauce:** Whisk all of the yogurt sauce ingredients together except for the salt and pepper. Taste, then add salt/pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve, or up to 3 days.
1. **Make the fritters:** Line a large bowl with a few paper towels or a clean, thin kitchen towel. (You can also use a cheesecloth for this step.) Place the shredded zucchini and onion inside. Add 1 teaspoon salt, and gently mix together. Top with another paper towel and press down so the paper towels begin absorbing some liquid. Lift everything up using the bottom paper towel and, over the sink, wring/squeeze out as much liquid as you can. The goal is to remove as much moisture from the zucchini as possible. Give your hands a break if needed, then return to squeezing out more liquid. You will be amazed how much liquid you wring out!
1. Whisk the egg, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, garlic, parsley, mint, dill, and pepper together in a large bowl until combined. Fold in the vegetables, and then whisk in the cornmeal, cornstarch, and baking powder until everything is combined.
1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the skillet is hot, scoop up around 2 Tablespoons of the zucchini mixture. Place the mixture onto the hot skillet and gently flatten with a spatula. Repeat with a few more, making sure not to overcrowd the skillet. Cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip, then cook for 3 more minutes on the other side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, then repeat with the remaining zucchini mixture.
1. Serve warm fritters with yogurt sauce.
1. Cover and store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Reheat in the microwave, or use an air fryer at 375°F (191°C) for 3–4 minutes. You can also place them on a lined baking sheet and bake at 375°F (191°C) for 8–10 minutes.

## Notes

- **Make Ahead Instructions:** You can make the creamy yogurt sauce up to 3 days in advance. See step 1. You can also prepare the zucchini fritter mixture up to 24 hours ahead of time. Cover tightly and keep refrigerated. Liquid will begin to pool at the bottom of the bowl during this time. When ready to cook, stir in a sprinkle of cornmeal if needed to help absorb some of the liquid.
- **Freezing Instructions:** Cool fritters completely, then place in a freezer-friendly container and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw before reheating. See step 6 for reheating instructions.
- **Can I Make These Without Cornmeal & Cornstarch?** Yes. Skip both and use 1/2 cup (62g) all-purpose or whole wheat flour instead. For a GF option, you can try using 6 Tablespoons (about 45g) of ground flaxseed.

## Ingredients

-   ¾ cup butter, softened
-   ¾ cup white sugar
-   ¾ cup packed light brown sugar
-   2 eggs
-   1 tsp vanilla extract
-   1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
-   1 tsp baking soda
-   ¾ tsp ground cinnamon
-   ½ tsp salt
-   2 ¾ cups rolled oats
-   1 cup raisins (or chocolate chips)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375° F (190° C).
1. In large bowl, cream together butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs and vanilla until fluffy.
1. In another bowl, stir together flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Gradually beat into butter mixture. Stir in oats and raisins. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto un-greased cookie sheets.
1. Bake 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Cool slightly, remove from sheet to wire rack. Cool completely.

## Notes

-   Lining the cookie sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper can be used to keep food moist, cook it evenly, and make clean-up easier.
